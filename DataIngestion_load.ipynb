Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ...,headh)WO\\nwhere headi = Attention(QWQ\\ni , KWK\\ni , V WV\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matricesWQ\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dk , WK\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dk , WV\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dv\\nand WO ∈ Rhdv×dmodel .\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

Traditionally such systems rely on an object detection network as a vision encoder to capture visual features and then produce text via a text decoder. Given a large amount of existing literature, in this post, I would like to only focus on one approach for solving vision language tasks, which is to extend pre-trained generalized language models to be capable of consuming visual signals.\\nI roughly group such vision language models (VLMs) into four buckets:\\n\\nTranslating images into embedding features that can be jointly trained with token embeddings.\\nLearning good image embeddings that can work as a prefix for a frozen, pre-trained language model.\\nUsing a specially designed cross-attention mechanism to fuse visual information into layers of the language model.\\nCombine vision and language models without any training.\\n\\nJointly Training with Image and Text#\\nOne straightforward approach to fuse visual information into language models is to treat images as normal text tokens and train the model on a sequence of joint representations of both text and images. Precisely, images are divided into multiple smaller patches and each patch is treated as one “token” in the input sequence.\\nVisualBERT (Li et al. 2019) feeds both text inputs and image regions into BERT such that it is able to discover the internal alignment between images and text with self-attention mechanism.\\n\\n\\nVisualBERT is trained on the combination of both text and image embeddings. (Image source: Li et al. 2019)\\n\\nSimilar to text embedding in BERT, each visual embedding in VisualBERT also sums up three types of embeddings, tokenized features $f_o$, segmentation embedding $f_s$ and position embedding $f_p$, precisely:\\n\\n$f_o$ is a visual feature vector computed for a bounding region of the image by a convolutional neural network;\\n$f_s$ is a segment embedding to indicate whether the embedding is for vision not for text;\\n$f_p$ is a position embedding used for aligning the order of bounding regions.\\n\\nThe model is trained on MS COCO image caption dataset with both text and image as inputs to predict text captions, using two visually-grounded language model objectives:\\n\\nMLM with the image. The model needs to predict masked text tokens, while image embeddings always stay not masked.\\nSentence-image prediction. When provided with an image and two associated captions, one of two captions might be a random unrelated caption with 50% probability. The model is asked to distinguish these two situations.\\n\\nAccording to ablation experiments, the most important configuration is to fuse visual information early on into the transformer layers and to pretrain the model on the COCO caption dataset. Initialization from a pre-trained BERT and the adoption of the sentence-image prediction training objective have relatively small impacts.\\n\\n\\nAblation study results of VisualBERT on NLVR. (Image source: Li et al. 2019)\\n\\nVisualBERT outperforms SoTA at the time on NLVR and Flickr30K, but still has some performance gap with SoTA on VQA.\\nSimVLM (Simple Visual Language Model; Wang et al. 2022) is a simple prefix language model, where the prefix sequence is processed with bi-directional attention like BERT, but the main input sequence only has causal attention like GPT. Images are encoded as prefix tokens such that the model can fully consume the visual information and then generates associated text in an autoregressive manner.\\nInspired by ViT and CoAtNet, SimVLM splits the image into smaller patches in a flatten 1D sequence of patches. They use the convolutional stage consisting of the first 3 blocks of ResNet to extract contextualized patches and this setup is found to work better than a naive linear projection.\\n\\n\\nTraining architecture for SimVLM, where the image patches are processed by the cross-attention encoder and the text decoder has causal attention. (Image source: Wang et al. 2022)\\n\\nTraining data for SimVLM consists of a large number of image-text pairs from ALIGN (Jia et al. 2021) and text-only data from C4 dataset (Raffel et al. 2019). They mix the two pretraining datasets within each batch, containing 4,096 image-text pairs (ALIGN) and 512 text-only documents (C4).\\nAccording to ablation studies, it is important to have both image-text and text-only data for training. The PrefixLM objective outperforms both span corruption and naive LM.\\n\\n\\nAblation study results of SimVLM on VQA. (Image source: Wang et al. 2022)\\n\\nCM3 (Causally-Masked Multimodal Modeling; Aghajanyan, et al. 2022) is a hyper-text language model, learning to generate the content (hypertext markup, hyperlinks and images) of large scale HTML web pages of CC-NEWS and Wikipedia articles. The resulting CM3 models can generate rich structured, multi-modal outputs while conditioning on arbitrary masked document contexts.\\nArchitecture-wise, CM3 is an autoregressive model. However, in order to combine causal and masked language modeling, CM3 also masks out a small number of long token spans and tries to generate them at the end of the sequences.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how a causally masked language model works. (Image source: Aghajanyan, et al. 2022)\\n\\nThe training dataset for CM3 contains close to 1T Web data. During preprocessing, images are first downloaded from src and resized to 256 x 256 with random cropping. Then they are tokenized by VQVAE-GAN, resulting in 256 tokens per image. These tokens, joined with spaces, are inserted back into the src attribute.\\nCM3 can be used to complete several types of tasks by prompt engineering:\\n\\nImage in-filling:\\n\\nInfilling Prompt: <figure>\\n\\t<img src=\"{prefix}<mask:0>{postfix}\"><mask:0>\\n\\nConditional image in-filling:\\n\\nConditional Infilling Prompt:\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img alt=\"Photo: {text}\" src=\"{prefix}<mask:0>{postfix}\"><mask:0>\\n\\nConditional image generation:\\n\\nConditional Generation Prompt: <figure>\\n\\t<img alt=\"{prompt}\\n\\nImage captions:\\n\\nCaptioning Masked Prompt #1: \\n<figure>\\n\\t<img alt=\"Photo: A photo taken of<mask:0>\" src=\"{image}\">\\n\\nCaptioning Causal Prompt #1: \\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\"{image}\" title=\"Photo: A photo taken of\\n\\nEntity disambiguation\\n\\nOriginal: Manetho writes that these kings ruled from <a title=\"Memphis, Egypt\">Memphis</a>\\n\\nPrompt: Manetho writes that these kings ruled from <a title=\"<mask:0>\">Memphis</a>...<mask:0>\\n\\nTarget: Manetho writes that these kings ruled from <a title=\"<mask:0>\">Memphis</a>...<mask:0> Memphis, Egypt\\nLearned Image Embedding as (Frozen) LM Prefix#\\nWhat if we don’t want to change the language model parameters when adapting it to handle visual signals? Instead we learn such an embedding space for images that it is compatible with the language model’s.\\nInspired by prefix or prompt tuning, both Frozen (Tsimpoukelli et al. 2021) and ClipCap (Mokady, Hertz & Hertz, 2021) only update the parameters of the vision module during training to produce image embeddings that can work with a pretrained, frozen language model. Both are trained with aligned image caption datasets to produce the next text token in caption conditioned on the image and previous text tokens. The powerful language capability is retained by freezing LM parameters. In addition, even though such setup is trained with limited image caption data, they can also rely on the encyclopedic knowledge of the language model at test time.\\nThe vision encoder of Frozen is based on NF-ResNet-50 and uses the final output vector of the NF-Resnet after the global pooling layer. The Frozen VLM can be used as a multi-model few-shot learner to adapt to new tasks at test time for zero-shot or few-shot transfer with a sequence of interleaved images and text.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of Frozen model (left) training architecture and (right) testing pipeline. (Image source: Tsimpoukelli et al. 2021)\\n\\nExperiments showed that fine-tuning the pre-trained LM interestingly leads to worse performance on VQA tasks. It is important to initialize the language model from a pre-trained version, as training from scratch (${Frozen}_\\\\text{scratch}$) does not show any meaningful progress. The baseline ${Frozen}_\\\\text{train-blind}$ blacks out the image but still can achieve decent performance because of the innate power of the pre-trained LM.\\n\\n\\nPerformance of different versions of Frozen on (left) VQAv2 and (right) OKVQA, trained on Conceptual Captions. \"Frozen scratch\" does not load a pre-trained LM and is trained from scratch. \"Frozen finetuned\" has the language model finetuned, while \"Frozen\" keeps LM frozen. \"Frozen train-blind\" blacks out the image. (Image source: Tsimpoukelli et al. 2021)\\n\\nClipCap relies on CLIP (Radford et al. 2021) for vision encoding, but it needs to be processed by a light mapping network $F$ such that image embedding vectors are translated into the same semantic space as the pre-trained LM. The network $F$ maps CLIP embeddings into a sequence of $k$ embedding vectors, each with the same dimension as a word embedding in GPT2. Increasing the prefix size $k$ helps improve the performance. Both CLIP vision encoder and the LM are frozen during training and only the mapping network $F$ is learned. They found that when LM is frozen, $F$ should be a transformer, with 8 multi-head self-attention layers with 8 heads each, but when LM can be fine-tuned, a MLP is enough.\\nEven though ClipCap only trains such a minimum set of parameters, it still achieves decent performance on image captioning tasks, comparable with SoTA at the time (e.g. Oscar, VLP, BUTD). Hence they postulate that “the CLIP space already encapsulates the required information, and adapting it towards specific styles does not contribute to flexibility.”\\n\\n\\nOverview of ClipCap training pipeline where only the mapping network needs to be train to transform CLIP image embedding to work with the pre-trained LM. (Image source: Mokady, Hertz & Hertz, 2021)\\n\\nThe fun fact is - because ClipCap translates CLIP image embeddings into LM space, the processed prefixes can be even interpreted as words.\\n\\n\\nThe learned image embedding can be interpreted as text, containing words related to the image context. (Image source: Mokady, Hertz & Hertz, 2021)\\n\\nText-Image Cross-Attention Fuse Mechanisms#\\nTo more efficiently fuse visual information into different layers of the language model, we can consider a specially designed cross-attention fuse mechanism to balance the mixture of text generation capacity and visual information.\\nVisualGPT (Chen et al. 2021) employs a self-resurrecting encoder-decoder attention mechanism to quickly adapt the pre-trained LM with a small amount of in-domain image-text data.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of VisualGPT architecture. (Image source: Chen et al. 2021)\\n\\nLet $I$ be the output of a visual encoder and $H$ be the hidden state of the LM decoder. VisualGPT introduced a self-resurrecting activation unit (SRAU) to control the tradeoff between a mixture of pre-trained linguistic information $H$ and visual component, $\\\\text{EncDecAttn}(H, I)$ via two complementary gates $B^\\\\text{vis}$ and $B^\\\\text{lan}$:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n& B^\\\\text{vis} \\\\otimes \\\\text{EncDecAttn}(H, I) + B^\\\\text{lan} \\\\otimes H \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{where }\\n& B^\\\\text{vis}[i,j] = \\\\sigma(H[i,j]) \\\\mathbb{1}[\\\\sigma(H[i,j]) > \\\\tau] \\\\\\\\\\n& B^\\\\text{lan}[i,j] = (1 - \\\\sigma(H[i,j])) \\\\mathbb{1}[1 - \\\\sigma(H[i,j]) > \\\\tau] \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\otimes$ is element-wise multiplication and $[i,j]$ denotes one element in the matrix. $\\\\tau$ is a predefined threshold hyperparameter.\\n\\n\\nComparison of different models trained on 0.1% and 1% of the MS COCO and Conceptual Caption datasets. (Image source: Chen et al. 2021)\\n\\nVC-GPT (Visual Conditioned GPT; Luo et al. 2022) combines a pretrained visual transformer (CLIP-ViT) as visual encoder and a pretrained LM as language decoder.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of VC-GPT training framework. (Image source: Luo et al. 2022)\\n\\nThe CLIP-ViT takes a sequence of image patches as inputs and outputs representation for each patch. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, instead of injecting the visual information directly into GPT2, VC-GPT introduces extra cross-attention layers on top of the output of visual encoder and language decoder. Then a self-ensemble module linearly combines the single model language decoder logits $h^G$ and cross-model vision-language fused module logits $h^\\\\text{fuse}$. The self-ensemble module (see “VC-GPT w/o SE” in Fig. 13) is important for the performance.\\n$$\\n\\\\text{logits} = W^G h^G + W^\\\\text{fuse}h^\\\\text{fuse}\\n$$\\nwhere $W^G$ is a linear projection of the language decoder, initialized by the word embedding matrix of GPT2 and $W^\\\\text{fuse}$ is a linear projection of the fusion module and initialized randomly.\\n\\n\\nPerformance of VC-GPT on the MS COCO test set, in comparison with other end-to-end image captioning baseline models. Metric abbreviation:  C = CIDEr; B = BLEU; M = METEOR; S = SPICE. (Image source: Luo et al. 2022)\\n\\nMERLOT (Zellers, et al. 2021) is trained with 6 millions of YouTube videos with transcribed speech (YT-Temporal-180M) to learn both spatial (frame-level) and temporal (video-level) objectives and demonstrated strong performance on VQA and visual reasoning tasks when fine-tuned.\\nEach video $\\\\mathcal{V}$ is split into multiple segments $\\\\{ \\\\boldsymbol{s}_t \\\\}$, each segment $\\\\boldsymbol{s}_t$ containing an image frame $\\\\mathbf{I}_t$ extracted from the middle timestep and $L=32$ tokens of words associated. Images are encoded by a learned image encoder and words are encoded using a learned embedding. Then both are encoded together within a joint vision-language transformer.\\nThere are 3 learning objectives in MERLOT:\\n\\nMasked language modeling (MLM) is useful especially because in videos, people tend to ramble, resulting in many repeated keywords or filler words.\\nContrastive frame-caption matching uses the language-only part from the joint vision-language transformer. Matched representations for each frame $\\\\mathbf{I}_t$ and caption $\\\\boldsymbol{w}_t$ are treated as positive examples, while the negative examples come from all other frame-caption pairs in the minibatch.\\nTemporal reordering learns temporal reasoning: scramble random $i$ frames and replace the segment-level position embeddings with a random and unique position embedding. The random position embeddings are learned, allowing the model to unshuffle these “‘shuffled’” frames conditioned on correctly-ordered ones. The loss is to predict whether $t_i < t_j$ or $t_j < t_i$ for each frame-frame pair.\\n\\n\\n\\nIllustration of MERLOT training framework: (Left) contrastive frame-caption matching training; (Right) joint vision-language transformer is trained with MLM loss, as well as on the temporal reordering task to unshuffle scrambled video frames. (Image source: Zellers, et al. 2021)\\n\\nAblation studies showed that it is important to (1) train on videos instead of images, (2) scale up the size and diversity of the training dataset and (3) use diverse objectives to encourage full-stack multimodal reasoning.\\nFlamingo (Alayrac et al. 2022) is a visual language model that accepts text interleaved with images/videos and outputs free-form text. Flamingo connects a pretrained LM and a pretrained vision encoder (i.e. CLIP image encoder) via a transformer-based mapper. To more efficiently incorporate vision signals, Flamingo adopts a Perceiver-based architecture to produce a few hundreds of tokens out of a large number of visual input features and then use cross-attention layers interleaved with the LM layers to fuse visual information into the language decoding process. The training objective is an autoregressive, NLL loss.\\n\\nThe Perceiver resampler receives spatio-temporal features from the vision encoder of image/video inputs to produce fixed-size visual tokens.\\nThe frozen LM is equipped with newly initialized cross-attention layers interleaved between the pretrained LM layers. Thus the LM can generate text conditioned on the above visual tokens.\\n\\nSimilar to ClipCap, both pretrained models are frozen during training and thus Flamingo is only trained to harmoniously connect existing, powerful language and vision models together. Tha main difference between ClipCap and Flamingo is that the former treats the image embedding as simple prefix for LM, while the latter uses the gated cross-attention-dense layer to fuse image information. In addition, Flamingo incorporates a lot more training data than ClipCap.\\n\\n\\nOverview of the Flamingo model. (Image source: Alayrac et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe architecture illustration and pseudo code of the gated cross-attention-dense layer in Flamingo. (Image source: Alayrac et al. 2022)\\n\\nTo easily handle text with interleaved images, masking in Flamingo is designed such that text token only cross-attends to visual tokens corresponding to the last preceding image, largely reducing the number of visual tokens that a certain text token can see. They found this works better than allowing text tokens to attend to all preceding images directly. Text still can attend to all previous images because there is a causal self-attention dependency in the text encoder. This design can deal with an arbitrary number of images in the context.\\nThey scraped 43 million webpages from the Internet, named MultiModal MassiveWeb (M3W) dataset, containing text with interleaved images. In addition, Flamingo is also trained on paired image/text and video/text datasets, including ALIGN, LTIP and VTP.\\nData processing of the Internet dataset includes:\\n\\nThe input Web page text is processed by inserting <image> tags at the location of visual inputs, as well as special tokens, <BOS> (beginning of sentence) and <EOC> (end of chunks; always at the end of the document, before any image tag).\\nFrom each document, they sample a random subsequence of $L = 256$ tokens and take up to $N = 5$ images included in the sampled sequence (using only the first $N$ within that sampled subsequence if there are more, or padding to $N$ if fewer)\\nA function $\\\\phi: [1,L] \\\\to [0,N]$ is computed to track the text and image interleaving order, which assigns to each text position the index of the last image/video appearing before this position; 0 if no preceding visual data.\\n\\nSince Flamingo is trained on a mixture of three different datasets, it optimizes for a weighted sum of dataset-specific NLL losses. Tuning the dataset weights is very important for the final performance. In practice, instead of round-robin between datasets, they actually sample one batch from each dataset and apply a weighted sum of these gradients in each update. Gradient accumulation across different heterogeneous datasets can be viewed as a mean to stabilize training, as it reduces the gradient variance between each update.\\nAt test time, Flamingo naturally supports few-shot learning since it can work with any sequence of interleaved text and images. And more examples in the context contribute to better performance.\\n\\n\\nLarger model sizes and more few-shot examples lead to better performance. (Image source: Alayrac et al. 2022)\\n\\nFlamingo outperforms SoTA fine-tuned models on 6 out of the 16 tasks despite even when not using any fine-tuning but only few-shot prompting. Fine-tuning Flamingo is expensive and it is difficult to do hyperparemeter tuning, but it does lead to better results.\\n\\n\\nPerformance of Flamingo model using different numbers of shots and of different sizes, in comparison with SoTA fine-tuned baseline. (Image source: Alayrac et al. 2022)\\n\\nCoCa (Contrastive Captioner; Yu & Wang et al., 2022) captures both the merits of contrastive learning and image-to-caption generation. It is a model jointly trained with contrastive loss on CLIP-style representation and generative loss on image captioning, achieving SoTA zero-shot transfer on a variety of multi-modal evaluation tasks.\\n\\n\\nOverview of CoCa training framework. (Image source: Yu & Wang et al., 2022)\\n\\nCoCa is pretrained from scratch, using web-scale alt-text data ALIGN and annotated images by treating all labels as texts in JTB-3B.\\nThere are two major training components in CoCa. The final loss is a weighted sum of the following two losses, with weight scalars $\\\\lambda_\\\\text{cap}=2.0, \\\\lambda_\\\\text{con} = 1.0$.:\\n\\n$\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{con}$ -  Dual-encoder contrastive learning optimizes the symmetric contrastive learning loss, similar to CLIP.\\n$\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{cap}$ - Encoder-decoder captioning has the decoder predict the caption based on the latent encoded features from the image encoder, by optimizing an autoregressive loss. The text decoder is decoupled into two components, unimodal and multimodal; a good balance is to split the decoder by half for these two components:\\n\\nThe bottom unimodal component encodes the input text with causally-masked self-attention.\\nThe top multimodal component applies both causally-masked self-attention and cross-attention to the output of the vision encoder.\\n\\n\\n\\nCoCa performs better than the contrastive-only model and on par with the captioning-only model on VQA. Captioning loss is found to be beneficial to the zero-shot classification capacity too.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how CoCa can be used to solve various downstream tasks at test time. (Image source: Yu & Wang et al., 2022)\\n\\nThey use task-specific attention pooling, or attention pooler, as a natural task adapter, as they found that a single pooled image embedding helps visual recognition tasks (e.g. ImageNet classification), while a more fine-grained embedding helps multimodal understanding tasks (e.g. VQA). A pooler is a single multi-head attention layer with $n_\\\\text{query}$ learnable queries (note that $\\\\mathbf{X} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L \\\\times d}$, $\\\\mathbf{W}^q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d \\\\times d_q}$, and $d_k = d_q$), with the encoder output as both keys and values. CoCa uses attentional poolers in pretraining for generative loss $n_\\\\text{query} = 256$ and contrastive loss $n_\\\\text{query} = 1$. This enables the model to obtain strong performance as a frozen encoder where we only learn a new pooler to aggregate features.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code for CoCa architecture and training. (Image source: Yu & Wang et al., 2022)\\n\\nNo Training#\\nFinally it is possible to solve vision language tasks by stitching pretrained language and vision models together without training any additional parameters.\\nDecoding Guided with Vision-based Scores#\\nMAGiC (iMAge-Guided text generatIon with CLIP; Su et al. 2022) does guided decoding according to a CLIP-based score named magic score to sample the next token, without fine-tuning. The generated text is encouraged to be relevant to the given image, while still stay coherent to the previously generated text.\\nThe next token $x_t$ at a time step $t$ is selected according to the following equation. Model confidence and degeneration penalty (Su et al. 2022) are added to avoid corrupted generation from LM.\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n& x_t = \\\\arg\\\\max_{v \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}^{(k)}} \\\\big\\\\{ (1-\\\\alpha) \\\\underbrace{p(v \\\\vert \\\\boldsymbol{x}_{<t})}_\\\\text{model confidence} - \\\\alpha \\\\underbrace{\\\\max_{1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq t-1} { \\\\text{cosine}(h_v, h_{x_j})}}_\\\\text{degeneration penalty} + \\\\beta \\\\underbrace{f_\\\\text{magic}(v \\\\vert \\\\mathcal{I}, \\\\boldsymbol{x}_{<t}, \\\\mathcal{V}^{(k)})}_\\\\text{magic score} \\\\big\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{where } & f_\\\\text{magic} ( v \\\\vert \\\\mathcal{I}, \\\\mathbf{x}_{<t}, \\\\mathcal{V}^{(k)} )\\n= \\\\frac{ \\\\exp(\\\\text{CLIP}(\\\\mathcal{I}, [\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{<t}:v])) }{ \\\\sum_{z \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}^{(k)}} \\\\exp(\\\\text{CLIP}(\\\\mathcal{I}, [\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{<t}:z])) }\\n= \\\\frac{ \\\\exp\\\\big({h^\\\\text{image}(\\\\mathcal{I})}^\\\\top h^\\\\text{text}([\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{<t}:v])\\\\big) }{ \\\\sum_{z \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}^{(k)}} \\\\exp\\\\big({h^\\\\text{image}(\\\\mathcal{I})}^\\\\top h^\\\\text{text}([\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{<t}:z])\\\\big) }\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{I}$ is the input image; $\\\\mathcal{V}^{(k)}$ contains top-$k$ possible tokens predicted by the language model $p$; $\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{<t}$ refers to the past generated tokens before time step $t$; $h_v$ is the representation of the token $v$ computed by LM conditioned on the concatenation of $\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{<t}$ and $v$; $h^\\\\text{image}(.)$ and $h^\\\\text{text}(.)$ are embeddings generated by CLIP image and text encoders, respectively.\\nMAGiC has decent performance compared to other unsupervised approaches, but still has big gaps with supervised methods.\\n\\n\\nImage captioning performance on COCO and Flickr30k. (Image source: Su et al. 2022)\\n\\nLanguage as Communication Interface#\\nFor knowledge-based VQA tasks, PICa (Prompts GPT-3 via the use of Image Captions; Yang et al. 2021) first converts the images into captions or tags and then uses few-shot examples to prompt GPT3 to provide answers. Image captions or tags are extracted by some existing models (e.g. VinVL) or Azure Tagging API. And GPT3 is considered as an unstructured, implicit knowledge base.\\n\\n\\nHow PICa works for $n$-shot VQA at inference time. (Image source: Yang et al. 2021)\\n\\nPICa explored two ways to improve few-shot examples to achieve better results:\\n\\nIn-context examples are selected based on how similar they are to the question using CLIP embedding.\\nMulti-query ensembling is to prompt the model multiple times to get multiple answers and the one with highest logprob is selected.\\n\\nThis simple approach with only 16 examples improved SoTA on OK-VQA by +8.6 points and got decent performance on VQAv2.\\n\\n\\nPerformance of PICa on OK-VQA. \"PICa-Base\" has random in-context examples, while \"PICa-Full\" incorporates both similar in-context example selection and multi-query ensembling. (Image source: Yang et al. 2021)\\n\\nSocratic Models (SM) (Zeng et al. 2022) is a framework to compose multiple pretrained models for different modality via language (prompting) into one model without further training. Here language is considered as the intermediate representation by which different models can exchange information. The key idea is to use multi-model multimodal prompting, in which output of a non-language model is inserted into a language prompt and then it is used for LM for reasoning.\\nLet’s examine a concrete example. Given an ego-centric video (images + audio), SM can produce a summary of the person’s activity using text-to-text LM,  image-to-text VLM and speech-to-text ALM. They are chained as follows:\\n\\n\\n(Image source: Zeng et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\nthe VLM detects visual entities;\\nthe LM suggests sounds that may be heard;\\nthe ALM chooses the most likely sound;\\nthe LM suggests possible activities;\\nthe VLM ranks the most likely activity;\\nthe LM generates a summary of the Socratic interaction.\\n\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Socratic Model solution for image captioning. (Image source: Zeng et al. 2022)\\n\\nSM can generate image captions by first using VLM to zero-shot predict different place categories, object categories, image type and the number of people; and then the VLM-filled language prompt is fed into a causal LM to generate caption candidates. The Socratic approach still has performance gap with ClipCap on image captioning but pretty decent given it does not involve any training.\\n\\n\\nComparison of image captioning performance of different models on random 100 COCO text examples. (Image source: Zeng et al. 2022)\\n\\nSM framework is very flexible and can be used on a lot more complicated tasks other than image captions. For example, the egocentric perception (User inputs + VLM + LM + ALM) task is to take as inputs egocentric videos to (1) summarize content; (2) answer free-form reasoning questions; (3) and do forecasting.\\n\\n\\nThe Socratic Model approach for generating captions and question answering based on the egocentric videos. (Image source: Zeng et al. 2022)\\n\\nDatasets#\\nImage Caption Datasets#\\n\\nMS COCO (Chen et al. 2015): contains 328K images and each paired with 5 independent captions.\\nNoCaps (Agrawal et al., 2019) is designed to measure generalization to unseen classes and concepts, where in-domain contains images portraying only COCO classes, near-domain contains both COCO and novel classes, and out-of-domain consists of only novel classes.\\nConceptual Captions (Sharma et al. 2018) contains 3 million pairs of images and captions, mined from the web and post-processed.
